Implemetnation of the minesweeper game in a Pygame interface

## Instructions of use:
* After running the main file 'minesweeper_main.py' a Tkinter window appears in which the size and the number of mines is to be introduced and then press the button 'Let's play!'
* A Pygame windows appear with white squares and the clock starts running. From this point the game is played as usual: left click on a square clean that square and a group of adjacent ones (or explodes a mine) and a right click sets up a flag.
* Once the game ends, either with a victory or a defeat, press spacebar to open again the settings Tkinter window.

## Future improvements
* Implement better aesthetics in the Pygame interface.
